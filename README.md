# University-Chat
University Chat is an online messaging application aimed at students at the University of Florida. University Chat provides students with course specific chat rooms to ask questions and have discussions with fellow classmates. 

The app serves as a quick source of information to students from any grade level or major. While some courses utilize various third party applications already, there is no standard chat and the process for students to join these chats is often not well integrated into the course, sometimes resulting in people being left out of the group. To solve this problem, University Chat auto-generates a chat for each course and creates a way for students to easily join the chat.
